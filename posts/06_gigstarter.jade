block description

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Initial situation]<br/> Looking for translations when one is talking more than two languages can be frustrating. Because of the very nature of dictionaries that presumes unique source and translation languages, we often end up switching settings back und forth as our mind freely navigates between languages. Thanks to online dictionaries like Google Translate, transitions have greatly improved but there is still room for improvement.    

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Approach]<br/>With the task to experiment the design of a simple software with standard GUI elements, we iteratively designed an interface reflecting the needs of two possible types of users: people with a billigual education and pupils.  

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Result]<br/> We created a user interface concept practically removing the need of setting source and translation languages beforehand. It also seemlessly integrates monolingual dictionaries and ernable the user to keep track and organize the encountered vocabulary

        p.shadowTopCompensation If the user is not sure about the validity of the translation (which happens a lot when a foreign lanaguage is not perfectly mastered), there is a way to quickly “back-translate” in order to check if the context still fits.

   p <strong>Each language version of a Wikipedia article is a map on its own</strong><br/>As articles are  rarely able to cover a topic without refering to further articles, vast amounts of geographical networks (or maps) arise on wikipedia when articles are augmented with GPS coordinates.
