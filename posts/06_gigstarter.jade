  p.noMargin –<br/>Supervised by Prof. Boris Müller and Dorit Mielke at the<a href='http://www.fh-potsdam.de' target='blank'> University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany</a> and in collaboration with <a href='http://www.here.com' target='_blank'>Nokia HERE</a>


block description

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Initial situation]<br/> Within the frame of collaboration with Nokia HERE, we have been invited to think of how we could improve micro-coordination within small groups of people with the creation of new services. There was a focus on the Windows Mobile platform as it used to be the default OS of Nokia smartphones.

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Approach]<br/>After an input phase including an introduction in the user resarch methodes used at Nokia, we first looked for opportunities and use cases by using user journeys, generating ideas and narratives. After having picked an idea, we developed a service and designed a dedicated app.  

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Result]<br/> We created a service inspired by the crowdfounding plarform Kickstarter that would enable small groups of people to organize their common participation to events for which the purchase of an admission ticket is required (like concerts). Users are enabled to connect over the app and to pledge their participation to the social event. If a preset minimal amount of participants is reached, the social event is confirmed and the event tickets are conjointly purchased, however with an individual billing.

        p.shadowTopCompensation If the user is not sure about the validity of the translation (which happens a lot when a foreign lanaguage is not perfectly mastered), there is a way to quickly “back-translate” in order to check if the context still fits.

   p <strong>Each language version of a Wikipedia article is a map on its own</strong><br/>As articles are  rarely able to cover a topic without refering to further articles, vast amounts of geographical networks (or maps) arise on wikipedia when articles are augmented with GPS coordinates.
