block description

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Initial situation]<br/> Looking for translations as well as spelling and definition details within one language can become very cumbersome when one speaks more than one foreign language. Thanks to online dictionaries, transitions between languages have greatly improved but there is still room for improvement as switching sources or setting translation parameters remain time consuming tasks.    

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Approach]<br/>With the task to experiment the design of software with standard GUI elements, we iteratively designed an interface reflecting the needs of two possible types of users: people with a billigual education and pupils.  

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Result]<br/> We created a user interface concept removing the transitions induced by language switches and could bundle billingual as well as monolingual contents together within one single interface. The user is a also enabled to keep track and organize the encountered vocabulary.

        h4 A node-based ebook entry representation
        p Each book entry is represented in the catalog through a diagram summing up the quantities of its incoming and outcoming connections. Available in two perspectives, it visualizes alternatively the amount of users’ interactions (yellow) or the amount of authors’ citations (blue). Depending on the perspective, further related pieces of information could be also displayed.

   p <strong>Each language version of a Wikipedia article is a map on its own</strong><br/>As articles are  rarely able to cover a topic without refering to further articles, vast amounts of geographical networks (or maps) arise on wikipedia when articles are augmented with GPS coordinates.
