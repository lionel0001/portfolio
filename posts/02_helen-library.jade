  //- p #[b Initial situation]


  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Initial situation] — In the age of Google, Wikipedia and ebooks, public libraries can’t define themselves anymore as a space only dedicated to the exchange of books. They are in the urge to find a new role online that complements their physical presence.

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Approach] — In my bachelor thesis, I’ve investigated a way to turn the classical digital catalog into a digital network that could offer a social reading experience while retaining its classical functionalities. 

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Result] — The result of this process is a design concept based around the idea that if the library is to be seen as a network, ebooks are its nodes. In this context, those are linked together through authors’ citations, users’ highlights or recommendations and also allow connections with external websites.

   h1#concept Concept in details 

   p <strong>Each language version of a Wikipedia article is a map on its own</strong><br/>As articles are  rarely able to cover a topic without refering to further articles, vast amounts of geographical networks (or maps) arise on wikipedia when articles are augmented with GPS coordinates.
