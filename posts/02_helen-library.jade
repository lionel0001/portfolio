  //- p #[b Initial situation]


  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Initial situation] — In the age of Google, Wikipedia and ebooks, public libraries can’t define themselves anymore as a space only dedicated to the exchange of books. They are in the urge to find a new role online that complements their physical presence.

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Approach] — In my bachelor thesis, I’ve investigated a way to turn the classical digital catalog into a digital network that could offer a social reading experience while retaining its classical functionalities. 

  p #[span(class='inlineTitle') Result] — The result of this process is a design concept based around the idea that if the library is to be seen as a network, ebooks are its nodes. In this context, those are linked together through authors’ citations, users’ highlights or recommendations and also allow connections with external websites.

        h4 Letting the users collect, annotate and connect ebooks together
        p Helen enables the user to highlight text sections and to link those together in order to facilitate the connection of ideas and support the creation of personal knowledge (similar to the Memex). Linked highlights may be publically or privatly shared.

        h4 Harvesting citations
        p Helen takes over authors’ footnotes and citations in order to transform them into navigable links to ebooks and web pages. Although not directly reachable, physical books are also meant to be taken in account.

        h4 A node-based ebook entry representation
        p Each book entry is represented in the catalog through a diagram summing up the quantities of its incoming and outcoming connections. Available in two perspectives, it visualizes alternatively the amount of users’ interactions (yellow) or the amount of authors’ citations (blue). Depending on the perspective, further related pieces of information could be also displayed.

   p <strong>Each language version of a Wikipedia article is a map on its own</strong><br/>As articles are  rarely able to cover a topic without refering to further articles, vast amounts of geographical networks (or maps) arise on wikipedia when articles are augmented with GPS coordinates.
